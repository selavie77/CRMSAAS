*** Regular Licenses ***

Our Regular Licenses grant you the right to utilize the licensed item in a single end product. 
However, it's imperative to note that this license does not permit the use of the item in an end product intended for sale. 
Furthermore, it prohibits the creation of multiple products using the licensed item and prohibits actions such as resale, sublicense, or renting of the item.

- Allowed to use in one end product only
- Not allowed to use in an end product that's sold
- Not allowed to use to create multiple product
- Not allowed to re-sale, sublicense and rent

Attention freelancers and creative agencies:
Under the Regular License, you are permitted to charge your clients for your services in creating an end product. 
Nevertheless, it's essential to remember that this license cannot be applied to multiple clients or projects simultaneously. 
Each new client or project necessitates the procurement of a new Regular License.
